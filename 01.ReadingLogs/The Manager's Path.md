**From an engineer to an engineering manager**

# Management 101
## What to Expect from a Manager
### one-on-one meetings
- create human connection
- get rid of introvert
- building the trust
- regular 1-1 about whatever needs discussing
- for manager, can use 1-1 to discuss the status of projects with senior manager
- for IC, try not make it as status report meeting
### feedback and workplace guidance
- keep track of the feedback, good and bad, and use it when you write your self-review for the year
- rehearsal of presentation to your manager, can also receive another type of feedback. it is also a kind of respect.
- help to understand the value of the work you are doing
- when you become more senior, expect the type of feedback to change somewhat from personal feedback to team- or strategy-related input.

> **ASK THE CTO: BIG AMBITIONS**
> *I’ve just started working, but I already know that my career goal is to someday become a CTO myself. What should I be doing now to make that possible?*
> 
> The very first thing you need to learn is how to work. Maybe you know this already, but when I was first out of college, I didn’t really know how to do the job at all. Because the day-to-day work of tech is very different from school, there are probably a bunch of things you will learn about the process of being a working engineer. My specific advice would be to seek out a workplace where you can get mentorship and training in the aspects of doing the job (such as testing, project and product management, and collaboration) as well as learn new technical skills. You want to build a strong foundation of skills because you will need them to succeed.
> 
> I also advise you to find the best managers and mentors you can, and watch them work. Try to find people to work for who push you to succeed but also reward you for success, who inspire you to stretch yourself. Realize that stretching yourself is about more than just learning new technologies: great CTOs have strong communication skills, project management skills, and product sense, in addition to good technical sense. However, you also want to spend a lot of time writing code, and getting really good at understanding how high-quality code is written. This will probably take a few years of focus, and you can’t rush it.
> In addition, I encourage you to create and build a strong network of peers. One thing that early career engineers often don’t appreciate is how their current peers will turn into their future jobs. This peer group includes everyone from your schoolmates to your teammates to the people you meet at conferences and meetups. It’s OK to be a little bit shy, but most CTOs have to learn how to socialize with all sorts of people and create strong networks across companies.
> 
> One final thing to realize is that most CTOs are the CTOs of small companies. They are often the technical cofounders of startups. If you want to go down that path, the best thing to do is to work for a company that has a track record of people who have left it to found new companies. This is where you will meet your future cofounders and discover opportunities to get into new companies early.

## How to Be Managed
*Developing a sense of ownership and authority for your own experiences at work, and not relying on your manager to set the entire tone for your relationship*
- Spent time thinking about what you want
- You are responsible for your self
	- Knowing yourself is step one
	- Step two is going after what you want
- Give your manager a break
	- Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems.
	- Try not to make every 1-1 about how you need something, how something is wrong, or how you want something more. 
	- Asking for advice is always a good way to show respect and trust.
- Choose your manager wisely
	- how to play the game at the company
	- strong networks

# Mentoring
## Being a mentor
### Mentoring an Intern
- The first thing you need is some sort of project for this intern to work on
- Sit with him as much as possible these first few days.
- Preparing the project to tasks at hand, and breaking it down to milestones
**Listen Carefully**
- One of the early lessons in leadership, whether it is via direct management or indirect influence, is that people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand. 
- Repeat the question in different way
- Use those whiteboards
**Clearly communicate**

**Calibrate your response**

# Tech Lead
> I was more than just a good engineer. I was a good communicator. I could write clear documents, I could give presentations without melting down, and I could talk to people in different teams and different roles and explain what was going on. I was also good at prioritizing. I was eager to push work forward and decide what needed to be done next. Finally, I was willing to pick up the pieces and do what needed to be done to make progress.

> got distracted by technical details. go down rabbit hole after rabbit hole

> My job as tech lead was to continue to write code, but with the added responsibilities of representing the group to management, vetting our plans for feature delivery, and dealing with a lot of the details of the project management process.

**The tech lead role** is not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities that any engineer may take on once they reach the senior level. This role may or may not include people management, but if it does, the tech lead is expected to manage these team members to the high management standards of RTR tech. These standards include:

- Regular (weekly) 1-1 touchbases
    
- Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted
    
- Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring

If a tech lead is not managing directly, they are still expected to provide mentorship and guidance to the other members of the team.

The tech lead is learning how to be a strong technical project manager, and as such, they are scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging. They focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to increase the impact of the team’s work product. They are empowered to make independent decisions for the team and are learning how to handle difficult management and leadership situations. They are also learning how to partner effectively with product, analytics, and other areas of the business.

It is not required that an engineer work as a tech lead to progress, but it is the most common way for engineers to grow from senior engineer 1 -> 2 and is required to grow from senior engineer 2 to engineering lead. Realistically it is very hard to grow past senior engineer 2 without ever having acted as a tech lead, even on the individual contributor track, due to the importance at senior levels of leadership and responsibility.

> A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team.

> Being a tech lead is an exercise in influencing without authority.

balancing time between project management and writing code

it’s important to get your team into a schedule that allows them to be focused on development for long stretches of time, because _they_ will need to focus for several days on coding problems.
