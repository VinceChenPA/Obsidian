The first steps of adopting dbt are:

1. **Get familiar with dbt:** Learn about the basics of dbt, including its architecture, features, and benefits. You can do this by reading the dbt documentation, watching tutorials, and taking online courses.
2. **Set up your dbt development environment:** Install dbt and configure it to connect to your data warehouse. You can also set up a development environment for testing and debugging your dbt code.
3. **Create a dbt project:** Create a new dbt project and initialize it with your dbt configuration.
4. **Start building your data models:** Define your data models in SQL files. You can use dbt's Jinja2 templating features to make your code more reusable and dynamic.
5. **Test your data models:** Run dbt tests to ensure that your data models are accurate and reliable.
6. **Deploy your data models to production:** Once you are satisfied with your data models, you can deploy them to production using dbt's deployment features.

Here are some additional tips for adopting dbt:

* Start small and build up gradually. Don't try to migrate all of your data transformations to dbt at once. Start with a small set of data transformations and then add more as you gain experience.
* Get help from the community. There is a large and active dbt community that is always willing to help new users. You can ask questions on the dbt Slack channel, Stack Overflow, or the dbt Discourse forum.
* Use dbt best practices. There are a number of best practices for using dbt. You can find these best practices in the dbt documentation and in blog posts and articles written by experienced dbt users.

Adopting dbt can be a challenging task, but it is worth it in the long run. dbt can help you to build and maintain reliable and scalable data pipelines, which can save your data team a lot of time and effort.
