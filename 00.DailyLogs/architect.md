The terms "solution architect", "application architect", "infrastructure architect", and "application design" are often used interchangeably, but there are some key differences between them.

- **Solution architect** is responsible for defining the overall solution to a business problem. This may involve designing new applications, integrating existing systems, or recommending new hardware or software. Solution architects typically have a broad understanding of business and technology, and they must be able to think strategically and creatively.
- **Application architect** is responsible for designing and developing individual applications. This includes defining the application's architecture, designing the user interface, and specifying the technical requirements. Application architects typically have a deep understanding of the specific technologies that will be used to build the application.
- **Infrastructure architect** is responsible for designing and managing the underlying infrastructure that supports applications. This includes the physical hardware, software, and networks that make up the IT environment. Infrastructure architects must have a strong understanding of IT systems and how they work together.
- **Application design** is the process of creating the user interface and user experience for an application. This includes designing the layout of the screens, the flow of information, and the way users interact with the application. Application design is typically done by a team of designers, engineers, and usability experts.

In some organizations, the roles of solution architect, application architect, and infrastructure architect may be combined. However, in larger organizations, these roles are typically separated to allow for specialization and expertise.

Here is a table summarizing the key differences between the four roles:

|Role|Focus|Responsibilities|
|---|---|---|
|Solution architect|Overall solution to a business problem|Define the solution, integrate systems, recommend hardware/software|
|Application architect|Individual application|Design the architecture, user interface, technical requirements|
|Infrastructure architect|IT infrastructure|Design and manage the underlying infrastructure|
|Application design|User interface and user experience|Design the layout, flow of information, user interaction|

I hope this helps!
