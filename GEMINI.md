# Gemini Configuration for My Obsidian Vault

This file provides instructions for Gemini on how to interact with my Obsidian knowledge base.

## About This Vault

This is my personal knowledge base, also known as a "second brain," managed with Obsidian. It contains my daily logs, reading notes, domain-specific knowledge, and personal reflections. The main purpose is to capture, organize, and connect information that I find valuable.

## My Conventions

*   **File Naming:** Please use descriptive, lowercase, kebab-case filenames (e.g., `new-topic-name.md`).
*   **Language:** I use a mix of English and Chinese. Please feel free to use either or both as appropriate for the context.
*   **Markdown Style:**
    *   Use standard Markdown.
    *   Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between notes in the vault.
    *   When creating a new note, please start with a `# Title` that matches the filename.
*   **Templates:** When creating a new quick note, please use the content from `Templates/QuickNote_Template.md`.

## Directory Structure

*   `00.DailyLogs`: Fleeting notes, daily thoughts, and quick captures.
*   `01.ReadingLogs`: Notes and summaries from books, articles, and other content I consume.
*   `02.Domain`: In-depth knowledge on specific subjects (e.g., technology, health).
*   `03.Engineering`: Topics related to software engineering and my professional work.
*   `04.Career`: Notes and reflections on career development.
*   `05.Health`: Health-related topics.
*   `06.Personal`: Personal projects, goals, and ideas.
*   `99.Attachments`: Images and other attachments. Please place new attachments here.
*   `Templates`: Note templates.

## How You Can Help

*   **Create New Notes:** When I ask you to create a note, please place it in the most appropriate directory based on the content.
*   **Organize Information:** Help me move or refactor notes to better fit the structure.
*
*   **Answer Questions:** Use the information within this vault to answer my questions.

## My Preferences

*   Please be proactive in linking to existing notes when creating new content.
*   If a request is ambiguous, please ask for clarification.
*   Keep your responses concise and to the point.
